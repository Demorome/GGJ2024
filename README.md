# Snake ECS
An amateur project to reimplement the classic Snake game in Moonworks using its ECS tools, made for learning and practice.

It uses code and assets from the GGJ2024 (ROLL AND CASH: GROCERY LORDS) project, details given below.

# ROLL AND CASH: GROCERY LORDS

A game made in 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2024 using the [MoonWorks](https://github.com/MoonsideGames/MoonWorks) game framework.

Available [on itch.io](https://prophetgoddess.itch.io/roll-and-cash-grocery-lords).

In December 2024, Evan upgraded the code to use the latest version of MoonWorks. This now serves as a decent example of a small but complete game that uses the MoonWorks framework.

You will need to run the ContentBuilderUI project first. This will generate the content files necessary to build and run the game.
