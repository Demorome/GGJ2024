OUT OF MY WAY, SCUM!
DON'T LOOK AT ME, SHOP DRONE
I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO SPEAK TO ME
DON'T SPEAK TO ME, GIG WORM
YOU'RE AN APP JOCKEY... YOUR LIFE IS WORTHLESS
HAH! YOU DON'T HAVE LABOR PROTECTIONS!
YOU ARE BUT A WORM IN THIS LIFE...
GET LOST, FREAK!
IF YOU SPEAK TO ME, I'LL KILL YOU
DON'T TOUCH ME. I'LL CUT YOUR HANDS OFF
DON'T TALK TO ME. I'LL SIC LOSS PREVENTION ON YOU
DON'T PERCEIVE ME, SCUM!
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE CLOWN DNA
THEY ONLY LET YOU IN HERE TO WORK THE APPS, GRUB
MAYBE IN YOUR NEXT LIFE YOU WON'T BE AN APP WORKER
FROM THE MOMENT WE ARE BORN, WE ALL BEGIN TO DIE
IS THIS ALL THERE IS FOR ME? COLLECTING ITEMS?
I'M JUST HERE FOR THE SEXUAL FACE MASKS...
I THOUGHT THIS PLACE WOULD SELL MORE HIGH QUALITY MEATS
I'M LOOKING FOR THE FUNGAL PRODUCTS
I LIKE THAT YOU CAN BUY GRUBS HERE...
I'M LOOKING FOR SOME CURSÃ‰D OBJECTS...
WHY DOESN'T THIS PLACE SELL VINYL?
I CAME HERE TO BUY FINGER SKATEBOARDS BUT THERE AREN'T ANY
DEALS! DEALS! SO MANY DEALS!
DEALIOS! I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A SPREAD OF DEALIOS!
I LIKE A STORE WHERE YOU CAN DO ARBITRAGE ON THE SHOW FLOOR
I'VE NEVER SEEN MORE PRODUCTS...
YOU CAN GET A CURSED MIRROR AND A SIN-CHILLA HERE? ENTERING MY GOTH ERA...
WHERE ARE THE AUTHENTIC EARTH MICROPLASTICS?
I CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO KINDS OF SPIRITS...
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THESE INGREDIENT LISTS... WHAT'S "CARBON?"
IT'S SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND THESE INGREDIENTS... ARE MINT AND MILK DIFFERENT THINGS?
MY DOCTOR SAYS MY DIET NEEDS MORE MICROPLASTICS...
MY DOCTOR SAYS I'M DEFICIENT IN BLUEBERRIES...
MY DOCTOR SAYS I NEED TO CONSUME FEWER BONES
MY PHYSICAL THERAPIST SAYS I SHOULD BE BUYING MORE ELASTIC
MY WIFE WANTS ME TO GET HER A MINTY ANIMAL...
MY WIFE WANTS CARBON... I GOTTA FIND SOME...
MY PREGNANT WIFE HAS A CRAVING FOR HELIUM
MY HUSBAND'S SICK... HE NEEDS ELASTIC
MY HUSBAND'S DYING... HE NEEDS OATMEAL
MY HUSBAND'S ILL... HE NEEDS URANIUM...
MY HUSBAND IS CRAVING KELP...
MY BOYFRIEND'S MEMBRANES NEED SOME ECTOPLASM
MY BOYFRIEND'S MEMBRANES ARE DRYING OUT... THESE PRODUCTS MAY HELP
MY BOYFRIEND'S AT HOME DEMANDING MILK
IT'S MY BOYFRIEND'S BIRTHDAY... OATMEAL IS HIS FAVORITE
MY GIRLFRIEND JUST CAME HOME FROM THE WAR... I'M GETTING HER A GIFT
MY GIRLFRIEND DESERVES A GIFT. I SHOULD GET HER SOME GOLD
MY GIRLFRIEND IS SO BEAUTIFUL. IT'S BECAUSE OF THE RELICS SHE OWNS
MY GIRLFRIEND'S BIRTHDAY IS SO SPECIAL. I'LL GET HER AN ANIMAL
MY GIRLFRIEND IS BACK FROM THE WAR... SHE'LL NEED SUPERNATURAL SPIRITS TO RESTORE HER
MY GIRLFRIEND IS MADE OF SILICON... SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL...
MY LOVER ASKED ME TO GET THEM AN ANIMAL IF I WAS SERIOUS...
MY LOVER HATES THIS STORE. I SHOP HERE ON THEIR BEHALF
MY LOVER THINKS URANIUM IS SO COOL... THEY WANT URANIUM IN EVERYTHING
MY LOVER'S MAIN INGREDIENT IS BLUEBERRIES, TOO
MY LOVER IS ALLERGIC TO GOLD... I HOPE I DON'T BUY ANY
IT'S BACK TO SCHOOL TIME... MY CHILD NEEDS SOME FUNGUS
MY CHILD IS GOING TO A SLEEP AWAY CAMP... I'LL SEND THEM SOME SILICON IN A CARE PACKAGE
MY CHILD IS AWAY AT COLLEGE... I'LL SEND THEM A POWERFUL RELIC
I ALWAYS TELL MY CHILD, "KELP CAN HELP"
THEY SAY THAT ELECTRONICS CONTAIN A LOT OF SILICON
THEY SAY THAT ANIMALS OFTEN CONTAIN CARBON
MOST RELICS CONTAIN BONES AND SPIRITS, YOU KNOW
THESE DAYS, MOST CLOTHING IS MADE OUT OF ELASTIC
MOST FOOD IS MADE OF FUNGUS, MILK, OR OATMEAL
PHARMACEUTICAL ITEMS ARE GENERALLY MADE OF MILK
IN GENERAL, MOST GAS IS HELIUM. THAT'S A TIP FOR YOU
IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT COSMETICS ARE MADE OUT OF THESE DAYS
THEY SAY THAT FURNITURE CAN BE MADE OF ANYTHING
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS SO POWERFUL. IT CAN BE MADE OF ANYTHING
THEY SELL MANGA IN THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEPARTMENT
THE MANGA THEY SELL HERE ISN'T EVEN VERY GOOD!
DON'T LOOK AT ME. I'M JUST HERE FOR THE MANGA
THE SMALLEST ELEMENT ON THE PERIODIC TABLE IS HELIUM. THE LARGEST ELEMENT IS OATMEAL
THE RAREST INGREDIENT IS PROBABLY BLUEBERRIES...
IT FEELS LIKE EVERYTHING IS MADE OF SILICON THESE DAYS...
I'M DISGUSTED BY THE LOOK OF YOU!
GET YOUR CLAMMY HANDS OFF ME, PEON!
ARE YOU EVEN ALLOWED TO SHOP HERE?
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR HOURS... I STILL CAN'T FIND THE DEHYDRATED GOATS
DID YOU BUY THE FREEZE DRIED PONY? I WAS LOOKING FOR THAT...
IF YOU WERE THE ONE WHO BOUGHT UP ALL THE TOMBSTONES... I'LL KILL YA!
THIS PLACE SELLS HIGH FASHION...
ALL THIS NEWS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT IS STRESSING ME OUT...
I TRY NOT TO LOOK AT THE NEWS... IT'S ALWAYS SO NEGATIVE
THE NEWS ABOUT SMALL UGLY BIRDS WAS FREAKING ME OUT...
SPACERS ARE OUT OF CONTROL THESE DAYS... ARE YOU A SPACER??
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF NEGATIVE PRESS ABOUT URANIUM LATELY... I DON'T BELIEVE IT!
DONT LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT, FREAK. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN LIVING THROUGH. I WORK 18 HOUR SHIFTS AND YES I GET PAID WELL BUT IT'S STILL VERY STRESSFUL. MENTAL HEALTH IN MY FIELD IS IN THE TOILET. SO WHAT IF I LIKE TO BUY MYSELF A LITTLE TREAT TO COPE? I DON'T JUDGE YOU FOR BEING A POOR LITTLE WORM, SO DON'T JUDGE ME FOR SPENDING MY HARD EARNED MONEY THE WAY I WANT TO. I'M JUST TRYING TO STAY LEVEL HEADED, YOU KNOW? I DESERVE IT!! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY FACE!!!
DO YOU HEAR THE TRACK THAT'S PLAYING IN HERE? IT'S CALLED "WHAT A RIPPER - LIVING IN STYLE" AND IT WAS PRODUCED BY CLAYMAWR, THE HOTTEST NEW PRODUCER ON SOUNDLOUD. I DOWNLOADED THIS TRACK YESTERDAY AND LISTENED TO IT EIGHT TIMES A ROW WITHOUT STOPPING. IT'S A BOP! I COULDN'T STOP! SO I CAME HERE WITH MY CYBER DECK AND I GOT IT ON THE STORE'S PLAYLIST. YES, THAT WAS ME! I LIKE TO THINK OF MYSELF AS A CURATOR... SOCIETY IS HELD UP BY PEOPLE LIKE ME, TAKING THE RISKS TO EXPAND THE PEOPLE'S PLAYLISTS. IT'S A NOBLE DUTY AND I THINK I DO IT WELL
THE BATHROOM IS FOR PAYING CUSTOMERS ONLY.
IS THIS A FULFILLING CAREER FOR YOU?
SOMETHING SPECIAL HAPPENS WHEN AN INGREDIENT GOES NEGATIVE...
I'M LOOKING FOR THE INGREDIENTS WITH NEGATIVE PRICES
THEY SAY WHEN AN INGREDIENT GOES NEGATIVE, THE DRONES COME OUT
THOSE DRONES MAKE ME UNEASY...
IF YOU PISS IN THE BATHROOM WITHOUT BUYING SOMETHING, THEY MAKE YOU TAKE THE PISS BACK
IF YOU USE THE TOILET HERE WITHOUT PAYING, YOU HAVE TO HOLD THE POOP IN YOUR HAND AND LEAVE
I'M WATCHING THE TICKER FOR NEGATIVE INGREDIENTS...
