FOR EVERY WINNER... THERE IS A LOSER
CORNERED THE MARKET... AT THE CORNER STORE
AT THE END OF THE DAY... ONLY ONE CAN TAKE THE TROPHY
WHOSE WALLET IS FULL... AND WHOSE HEART IS EMPTY?
THE TRIUMPHANT ONE... AND THE DEFEATED ONE
CAPITALISM HAS ITS VICTORS... AND ITS CORPSES
ORDERS DELIVERED... AND THE RESULTS ARE IN
EVERYONE BLEEDS... ONLY SOME SUCCEED
WE DANCE WITH CAPITAL... OR WE ARE TRAMPLED
THE DAY IS DONE... AND THE APPS CHOOSE A VICTOR
